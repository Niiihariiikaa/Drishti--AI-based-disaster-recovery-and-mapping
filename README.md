 Natural disasters cause significant loss of life and property, and timely prediction and response are critical to minimizing
 their impact. Develop an Al system that predicts natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes using
 historical data and real-time inputs, and suggests optimal response strategies.
 Objective:
 Analyze the extent of natural disasters in various places
 Able to predict its extent and protect them
 Able to do real-time victim prediction using Yolo detection that will significantly help the rescuers in tracing people

**Drishti is an advanced AI-driven solution that focuses on
 comprehensive disaster prediction, impact assessment, and
 community engagement. The project leverages artificial
 intelligence and machine learning to enhance the efficiency
 of disaster response efforts. Designed to support
 government agencies, emergency services, and local
 communities, Drishti offers real-time insights into disaster
prone areas and facilitates organized recovery operations.**
